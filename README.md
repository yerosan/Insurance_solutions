   cd Insurance_solutions

   `````
Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Set up environment variables:

Make sure to create an .env file with appropriate variables for your environment (if needed).

Usage
Running the EDA Notebook
Navigate to the notebooks/ directory and open the Jupyter notebook to perform EDA:

```bash
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook EDA.ipynb
```
Running the EDA Script
To run the Python EDA script directly:

```bash
cd scripts
python eda.py
```
The results will be saved in the scripts/results/ directory as visualizations or outputs.
